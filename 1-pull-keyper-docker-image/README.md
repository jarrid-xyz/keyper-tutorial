# Pull Keyper Docker Image

There's two ways to use [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper), one is to run `./gradlew build` and run the compiled [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper) jar `java -jar ...`, another is to pull the pre-built [Keyper](https://jarrid.xyz/keyper) package from Github directly:

`docker pull ghcr.io/jarrid-xyz/keyper:v0.0.1`
